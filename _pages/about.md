My name is Justine Bateman. I have been a Belfast, NI based QA Engineer for 8 years. I enjoy learning new tools, technologies and programming languages, but my main language right now is Java. 

I have a lot of experience with setting up a QA process/strategy for teams that either don't have one at all, or feel like their current QA process isn't working for them. 

I also have a passion for teaching and mentoring. I love teaching other engineers what a good QA process consists of, and I enjoy helping junior QA's to progress in their own careers.

The purpose of this blog is to hold some of my thoughts and opinions on how QA can be done efficiently, and also to pass on some hopefully helpful knowledge on how to implement different QA tools in your projects. 

You can find samples of my automation work or general code experimentation in my GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/justinebateman" target="_blank">here</a>
